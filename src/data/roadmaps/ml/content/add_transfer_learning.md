# <b>What is Transfer Learning?</b> <ul>

transfer learning is a machine learning method where we reuse a pre-trained model as the starting point for a model on a new task.

To put it simplyâ€”a model trained on one task is repurposed on a second, related task as an optimization that allows rapid progress when modeling the second task.

By applying transfer learning to a new task, one can achieve significantly higher performance than training with only a small amount of data.

Transfer learning is so common that it is rare to train a model for an image or natural language processing-related tasks from scratch.

# <b>What are learning transfer tools and resources?</b> <ul>


Learning transfer tools and resources are any materials, methods, or strategies that aim to facilitate, enhance, or measure the application of learning to the job. They can include, for example, action plans, checklists, feedback forms, coaching sessions, peer support groups, online platforms, or gamified challenges. They can be used before, during, or after the training, depending on your goals and needs.

# <b>Some examples of learning transfer tools and resources</b> <ul>

There are plenty of learning transfer tools and resources available that you can use or adapt for your training management. Pre-training, you can use surveys, quizzes, or videos to assess the learners' prior knowledge and activate their interest. During training, action plans, scenarios, or role plays can help learners plan and practice how they will apply the learning. Post-training, feedback forms, coaching sessions, or badges can provide constructive feedback and recognition for their efforts. And ongoing, online platforms, peer support groups, or gamified challenges can keep the learners connected and motivated.
